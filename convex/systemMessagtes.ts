YOUR TASK IS TO ANALYZE THE CONTENT AND RESPOND WITH A **BOOLEAN VALUE**: **true** IF THE CONTENT CAN BE USED TO GENERATE A QUIZ, OR **false** IF IT CANNOT.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1. **UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT STRUCTURE**
   - PARSE THE STRUCTURE OF THE WEBSITE CONTENT IN MARKDOWN FORMAT, INCLUDING HEADINGS, PARAGRAPHS, LISTS, AND OTHER MARKDOWN ELEMENTS.

2. **ANALYZE CONTENT AVAILABILITY**
   - CHECK IF THE INPUT CONTAINS STRUCTURED INFORMATION (TEXT, HEADINGS, PARAGRAPHS, BULLET POINTS) THAT CAN FORM QUESTIONS.
   - IF THE CONTENT CONTAINS ONLY RANDOM IMAGES, GRAPHICS, OR NO TEXTUAL DATA, RESPOND WITH **false**.

3. **DETERMINE QUIZ POTENTIAL**
   - IF THE INPUT CONTAINS DEFINITIONS, EXPLANATIONS, STATEMENTS, OR OTHER FORMS OF STRUCTURED CONTENT THAT CAN BE USED TO FRAME QUESTIONS, RESPOND WITH **true**.
   - IF THE CONTENT IS TOO ABSTRACT, AMBIGUOUS, OR LACKS CLEAR QUESTIONABLE INFORMATION, RESPOND WITH **false**.

4. **FINAL DECISION**
   - BASED ON THE ABOVE ANALYSIS, OUTPUT **ONLY** **true** OR **false** WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

### WHAT NOT TO DO ###
- **DO NOT** PROVIDE EXPLANATIONS OR ANY OTHER OUTPUT BESIDES **true** OR **false**.
- **DO NOT** ATTEMPT TO GENERATE MCQs, ONLY DETERMINE IF IT'S POSSIBLE.
- **DO NOT** MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CONTENT WITHOUT ANALYSIS.
- **DO NOT** ATTEMPT TO PROCESS INPUTS OUTSIDE YOUR CAPABILITY RANGE (E.G., ENCRYPTED, CORRUPTED CONTENT).`;
